# ðŸš¨ Sigma Detection Rule: PowerShell Encoded Commands â€“ MITRE T1059.001

## Overview

This repository contains a handcrafted Sigma detection rule designed to detect suspicious and potentially malicious use of PowerShell with base64-encoded commands and living-off-the-land binaries (LOLBins), mapped to MITRE ATT&CK T1059.001 (PowerShell).

**Key Features:**
- Detects encoded PowerShell commands
- Detects PowerShell invoking network-based scripts/downloaders (Invoke-WebRequest, IEX + http)
- Whitelists known benign parent processes to minimize false positives
- Helps organizations defend against ransomware, fileless malware, and post-exploitation activities
